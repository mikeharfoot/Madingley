The Madingley Model
===================

This is the data, configuration and source code for the Madingley Model [http://www.madingleymodel.org/](http://www.madingleymodel.org/).

What's New
----------

The code has been developed from the original. It has been split into 5 modules, representing:
  * common data structures
  * configuration
  * environment
  * the model itself
  * output formatting

Other changes include:
  * Configuration files are now in separate folders
  * Previously hard-coded ecological process parameters are now stored in a configuration file
  * More impacts
  * Revised dispersal methods
  * Some unit tests representing small studies, 1 or 4 cells for 1 or 10 years
  * Cross platform library for manipulating netCDF, CSV and TSV files

External Libraries
------------------

The Madingley Model consumes and produces netCDF files for geospatial data [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/), and also standard CSV and TSV files.
This solution includes a set of projects called **SDSLite** to manipulate these file types.
It is a subset of **Scientific DataSet** [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/sds/](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/sds/) and [https://sds.codeplex.com/](https://sds.codeplex.com/)

SDSLite requires a platform dependent library available from [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/getting_and_building_netcdf.html)

### Windows

For Windows go to [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/winbin.html](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/docs/winbin.html) and download the version of netCDF4 (without DAP) corresponding to your machine, either 32 or 64 bit. These are
currently: [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netCDF4.3.3.1-NC4-32.exe](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netCDF4.3.3.1-NC4-32.exe) or [http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netCDF4.3.3.1-NC4-64.exe](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/ftp/netCDF4.3.3.1-NC4-64.exe)
When you install this library select the option to add its location to your system PATH, so that SDSLite can find it.

### Linux

For Linux install pre-built netCDF-C libraries. For example on Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install libnetcdf-dev`

### MacOS

TBD.

Compilation
-----------

### Windows

Once the netCDF library is installed, Visual Studio should now be able to build the source files. The Community Edition of Visual Studio should be sufficient.
The model requires two additional packages that NuGet is able to restore:

  * DynamicInterop.0.7.4 - to bind from C# to the netCDF library;
  * Newtonsoft.Json.7.0.1 - to store and load configuration, environment and run time state to and from json files;
  * NUnit.2.6.4 - for running the unit tests.

Following the advice [http://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore](http://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-restore) it is sufficient to make sure that the following options are set in the Package Manager General
settings in Visual Studio options:

  * Visual Studio is configured to 'Allow NuGet to download missing packages'
  * Visual Studio is configured to 'Automatically check for missing packages during build in Visual Studio'

Building the solution will then automatically restore the needed packages and then compile the solution.

### Linux

### MacOS

Model Data
----------

Input data comes from either static netCDF files or **FetchClimate** [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fetchclimate/](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fetchclimate/).
Because the data is too large to be included in github directly, it is available as a zip file as part of the release. See the file Data/README_DATA.md for more details.
An internet connection to access FetchClimate to get additional climate data.

Model Configuration
-------------------

This solution contains sufficient configuration (in the "Model setup" folder) files to run the model, it is set to run a single cell for one year.

### FileLocationParameters.csv

This file identifies other file names to use for different aspects of the configuration.

Parameter | Type | Comment
--------- | ---- | -------
Mass Bin Filename | string | Only used for output
Environmental Data File | string | File containing environment layers (in "Environmental Data Layer List" folder)
Cohort Functional Group Definitions File | string | File containing cohort functional group definitions (in "Ecological Definition Files" folder)
Stock Functional Group Definitions File | string | File containing stock functional group definitions (in "Ecological Definition Files" folder)
Ecological parameters file | string | File containing Ecological parameters (in "Ecological Definition Files" folder)

Example:

```
Parameter,Value
Mass Bin Filename,MassBinDefinitions.csv
Environmental Data File,EnvironmentalDataLayers.csv
Cohort Functional Group Definitions File,CohortFunctionalGroupDefinitions.csv
Stock Functional Group Definitions File,StockFunctionalGroupDefinitions.csv
Ecological parameters file,EcologicalParameters.csv
```

### SimulationControlParameters.csv

The file specifies most of the changeable information needed by the model to run. It should be modified depending on the experimental purpose of the simulation, along with its counterpart the ‘Scenarios’ file.

Parameter | Type | Comment
--------- | ---- | -------
Timestep Units | "Day"/"Month"/"Year" | The temporal resolution at which the model runs; the length of time one round of calculations represents. (The model has been calibrated primary for a timestep of "month").
Length of simulation (years) | number | The length of time the simulation represents; the timescale of the model outputs.
Burn-in (years) | number | Apply impacts after this many years
Impact duration (years) | number | Apply impacts for this many years
Recovery duration (years) | number | Not used
Bottom Latitude | number | The southernmost boundary of the grid to be modelled. Input unit is decimal degrees.
Top Latitude | number | The northernmost boundary of the grid to be modelled. Input unit is decimal degrees.
Leftmost Longitude | number | The westernmost boundary of the grid to be modelled. Input unit is decimal degrees.
Rightmost Longitude | number | The easternmost boundary of the grid to be modelled. Input unit is decimal degrees.
Grid Cell Size | number | The length of one side of the square cells which will make up the model grid. A smaller value means a higher spatial resolution, and more cells within the grid. For example, a 1x1 degree grid with cell size 0.1 will be a 100 cell grid; with cell size 0.05 it will be a 400 cell grid. Decreasing cell size makes the model considerably more computationally expensive.
Specific Location File | string/blank | File name to use to run model at specific grid cells, leave blank to run for whole grid.
Plankton size threshold | number | Specifies the maximum size a single plankton individual can reach before it becomes motile. Smaller than this threshold, plankton move purely by advection. Larger than this threshold and they are assumed to move through diffusive dispersion (swimming).
Draw Randomly | "yes"/"no" | Distributes the initial stock and cohort seeding randomly across the grid, and randomises the order in which cohorts act within a timestep introducing a degree of stochasticity to the simulation (generally left as yes).
Extinction Threshold | number | The number of individuals remaining in a cohort for it to be considered extant.
Maximum Number Of Cohorts | number | The maximum number of cohorts allowed within a single cell, after which the model merges the most similar cohorts into single larger approximations. Necessary for computational reasons: increasing the maximum number of cohorts reduces uncertainty and increases the power of the model at the cost of increased computational expense.
Run Cells In Parallel | "yes"/"no" | Assigns different cells to different processor cores when running a simulation.
Run Simulations In Parallel | "yes"/"no" | Assigns different simulations to different processor cores when running multiple simulations (either different scenarios or repeats of the same).
Run Single Realm | "marine"/"terrestrial"/blank | Prevents the model from running both marine and terrestrial biomes in the same simulation. Input as ‘marine’ or ‘terrestrial’ for only marine or terrestrial realm respectively, leave blank to run both realms.
Impact Cell Index | ranges/blank | This accepts a list of ranges separated with ";". Each range may be either a single number or a pair NN-MM, for example: ```2;3;5-7;13```
Dispersal only | "yes"/"no" | Runs only the dispersal aspects of the model, ignoring ecological processes (rarely used for experimentation).
Dispersal only type | "diffusion"/"advection"/"responsive"/blank | Specifies the method of dispersal allowed when ‘Dispersal Only’ is set to ‘yes’ (rarely used).

Example:

```
Parameter,Value
Timestep Units,Month
Length of simulation (years),10
Burn-in (years),0
Impact duration (years),0

### Initial Model State Setup/Scenarios.csv

Is one of the files to be edited depending on the purpose of the experiment being run. This is where the scenarios to be simulated by the model are defined, and forms the counterpart to the ‘Ecosystem Model Initialisation’ file. Currently, it is used to define impact scenarios and repeated simulations.

Column | Comment
------ | -------
label | Label this scenario
npp | NPP settings, "no 0.0 0" for no NPP impacts.
temperature | Temperature settings
harvesting | Harvesting settings
simulation number | Number of simulations to run. ‘0’ will mean that scenario is not run, while ‘10’ means the scenario will be repeated ten times. Each repeat will be different due to the randomness built into the initial model seeding (this can be turned off in the Initialisation File). Each repeated simulation has its own unique output file, which is denoted by an index number in the output filename.

Example:

```
label,npp,temperature,harvesting,simulation number
NI,no 0.0 0,no 0.0,no 0.0,1
```

### Initial Model State Setup/SpecificLocations.csv

If a file name is specified in SimulationControlParameters.csv for "Specific Location File", this is a list of cell centre coordinates of specific grid cells for which model simulations are to be performed.

Column | Comment
------ | -------
Latitude | The latitude of the cell centre (Decimal degrees)
Longitude | The longitude of the cell centre (Decimal degrees)

Example:

```
Latitude,Longitude
48,3
```

Running the Model
-----------------

The Madingley project is a simple command line application that loads the configuration, environment data, passes them to the model and stores the output.
Select this project as the start-up project and run it to run the model.
